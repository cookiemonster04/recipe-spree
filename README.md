# Recipe Spree
A recipe recommending website.
## Description
1. Purpose:   
RecipeSpree is an all-in-one cooking companion. From maintaining a recipe collection to discovering new delectable dishes, RecipeSpree is a universal portal that satisfies all of our clients’ cooking needs. 
2. Target audience: Home cooks
3. Motivation:  
We like good food, and while we can find recipes on YouTube or by googling and keep track of them using bookmarks, it’s cumbersome and we want to simplify this process for our users.
